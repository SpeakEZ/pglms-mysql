    <line speaker="1" cue="">The photograph has no head.</line>
    <line speaker="2" cue="">What are you saying?</line>
    <line speaker="1" cue="">The photograph has no head.  Which word do you not understand, photograph or head?</line>
    <line speaker="2" cue="">I understand the words, but I don't understand you.</line>
    <line speaker="1" cue="">Look, the photograph has no head.  How do I find a man when he has no head?</line>
    <line speaker="2" cue="">He has a head.</line>
    <line speaker="1" cue="">Fine.  He has a head.  How do I find a man when he has no face?</line>
    <line speaker="2" cue="">He has a face.</line>
    <line speaker="1" cue="">Fine. How do I find a man when I don't know what he looks like?</line>
    <line speaker="2" cue="">You do know what he looks like.  There's a picture right in front of you. I don't think you are
      a very good detective at all.  In fact, you are the worst detective I have ever met.  You think that a man can walk
      around without a head or a face.  Some detective.</line>
    <line speaker="1" cue="">I am the best detective in all of Latin America.</line>
    <line speaker="2" cue="">This isn't Latin America.</line>
    <line speaker="1" cue="">I know.  I know.  This is the United States.  Look, I think maybe we got off on the wrong foot.
      Let's try again.  What can you tell me about this man?</line>
    <line speaker="2" cue="">He lives not too far from here with his mother.  His name is William Morningstar.  He is 35
      years old.  He has black hair, blue eyes, and he's bald. But he's been missing for three weeks.</line>
    <line speaker="1" cue="">How can he have black hair and be bald?</line>
    <line speaker="2" cue="">Maybe he has red hair or blonde hair. I'm not sure.</line>
    <line speaker="1" cue="">But if he has hair, he's not bald.</line>
    <line speaker="2" cue="">Well, he has hair, but not very much hair.  He's mostly bald.</line>
    <line speaker="1" cue="">Anything else? Tall or short?  Good looking or ugly? Fat or skinny?</line>
    <line speaker="2" cue="">You are the worst detective ever.  Look at the picture.  Does he look fat?</line>
    <line speaker="1" cue="">OK.  OK.  OK.  How much?</line>
    <line speaker="2" cue="">How much for what?</line>
    <line speaker="1" cue="">How much money will you pay?</line>
    <line speaker="2" cue="">How much money will I pay for what?</line>
    <line speaker="1" cue="">How much money will you pay me to find this man?</line>
    <line speaker="2" cue="">Three thousand dollars.</line>
    <line speaker="1" cue="">Fine.  Fine.  I'll take the case.  I'll call you when I find out anything.  See you later.</line>
    <line speaker="2" cue="">Thank you.  And please don't forget the photograph.</line>
    <line speaker="1" cue="">Oh, the photograph.  Great.  Thanks again.</line>
    <line speaker="2" cue="">You're welcome. Latin America's greatest detective.  Humph.</line>
